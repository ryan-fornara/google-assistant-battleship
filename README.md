# Battleship

This action was created at the GDG New London July 2018 event.

Battleship Commander for the google assistant was coded in ~6 hours at a GDG New London Event. It is published and can be activated by saying "Talk to Battleship Commander" to any Google Assistant powered divice.

Feel free to create a branch to improve this project. Reach out to me and changes made can be published.
